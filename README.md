# Omni-PMS

Omni-PMS is a unified Project Management & Ticketing System (projects, tasks, tickets, notifications, analytics).

All documentation has been consolidated into `docs/CONSOLIDATED.md` — please use that as the single source of truth.

Quick start:
- Start both servers: `.\start.ps1`
- Backend: `cd backend && .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 && python manage.py runserver`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev`

For architecture diagrams, implementation plan, and detailed QA steps, see `docs/CONSOLIDATED.md` and the archived originals in `docs/archive/`.
